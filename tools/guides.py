"""Keep the guide lists on vpnonly.app in step with the guides themselves.

    python3 tools/guides.py

The homepage shows six guides: the newest one first, then the PINNED ones.
The guides page lists every guide, newest first, with its icon and the day it
went up. Both lists, and the sitemap, come from GUIDES below and from the day
each page first reached git, so nothing here needs dates by hand.

To add a guide:
  1. Copy a page in docs/guides/ as a template and write the new one.
  2. Add it to GUIDES with an icon, a title and a one-line summary.
     Optionally give it a shorter pitch for the homepage.
  3. Run this, look at the homepage and docs/guides/, and commit.

Icons are img:<file in docs/img/>, logo:<a mark in docs/logos.svg> or
glyph:<one of GLYPHS>.
