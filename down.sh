# Tear down the split tunnel: stop the WireGuard interface VPNonly created and
# remove its firewall rules. Nothing else on the machine is touched.
#
# One thing is deliberately left behind. An app launched through vpnrun keeps
# the vpnonly group until it exits, and macOS cannot take it out of the group
# while it runs. If any such app is still open, only the `pass` rule goes and
# the `block return` rule stays loaded, so the app is refused rather than
# quietly moved onto your normal connection. That is the kill switch, and it
# has to hold across a deliberate disconnect as much as a dropped one. Quit
# the app (Turn off in `vpnonly` quits and reopens it outside the group) and
# the next down.sh or up.sh clears the rest; `vpnonly` does that by itself
# once the last held app is gone.
